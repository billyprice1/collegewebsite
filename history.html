      				<p>Sandsfoot Castle, also known historically as Weymouth Castle, is an artillery fort constructed by Henry VIII near Weymouth, Dorset.</p>
      				<p>By the early 18th century, Sandsfoot was in ruins, its stonework taken for use in local building projects. The clay cliffs on which the castle had been built had always been unstable and subject to erosion.</p>

      				<h3>Modern Weymouth </h3>
      				<p>Weymouth was to play an important role during the history of the Second World War. As a result of the German occupation of the Channel Islands, Alderney's residents were evacuated into Weymouth in June 1940. Half a million soldiers set off from the port between D-Day on 6th June 1944 and 7th June 1945, mostly forming the group that landed on Omaha Beach.</p>
